              <h3> Animations and Interactions</h3>
              <p>

                Micro-interaction is the visual translation of what the user does (scroller, change page, click a button, etc.) in the product context. It is the detail that will create emotion in the user, improve its experience by bringing more life to the interfaces.</p>

              <h3> Storytelling</h3>
              <p>
                Its essential to know users are attracted to designs hence I do try to tell stories which each opportunity I have to make a product. Storytelling is used in design as a technique to get insight into users, build empathy and access them emotionally. For me its just a way to deliver the best possible user experience.</p>
